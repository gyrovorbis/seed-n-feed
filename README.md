= SeednFeed =
Seed n Feed is a cross-platform desktop app that manages feed rationing and livestock nutritional plans given a target weight. 

= Features =
The app is extensible in that new food types can be added and their nutritional values can be imported. It also allows for importing new types of livestock and establishing their RDAs for various nutrients. Taking these variables into account, the app will allow you to create a diet plan that is nutritionally adequate and calorically dense enough for a particular growth projection. A few other useful features are included, such as importing and exporting tables to and from excel.

= Development Status =
This app was originally developed for my father who was getting into cattle farming, but he's since moved on to other pursuits, leaving this app an unused piece of software that could potentially be useful to others or retrofitted into being something else.

I would rank the code quality as fairly high, as it's cross-platform, database driven, and dynamic in terms of data it can process. The software architecture is also fairly sound.
